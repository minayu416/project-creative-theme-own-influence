Since I started my programmer carrer, I have work as a back-end programmer for 2 years. In this period, I never let any projets/ products release or on-line running. Seriously, maybe there is a small project I cooperated with designer is on-line now. (I don't know if it will be stopped after I left company.)

So, I always think about is that my problems? Am I a bad programmer or my skills are not good that I can not release any project or product.

***You must be aware that making products is not easy thing, many start-up created but died at the first 3 years.***

After I left company was an employee and devoting to my product, then I connected all things together.

***When you argue the work is too heavy or this start-up company is very bad, your boss may annoy the problems of the selling of products, operation of company and other things.***

When I was doing the resignation process, I was writing those paper for passing process and I asked HR: `being a boss must not easy, if I'm boss, what things I'm thinking now ? Especially I'm a boss of 10000 people company.`

<br>

I don't have experience of being a boss, but I had experience of operating a medium alliance (300 people) in MMORPG online game and small alliance (60 people) in mobile game.

As a leader of an alliance have to process people problems every day and composing teams to attack monsters or other activities, also maintain the brand or concepts of alliance for recuit more players in alliance.

So only one person can not take many things on his/her shoulder, so leader must find more people to be the team/group leaders then helping manage the teams.

Until here, the leader is ths boss, those teams leaders are the supervisors of department.

So, if the team of operation people (HR) can not operate people well, then people will leave company. If sales can not sell products well, company can not earn money and cause the salary can not release to employees.

## How's going with software development team?

If there is a start-up, there are some roles:

- Boss
- HR
- Product Manager
- UI Designer
- UX Designer
- Front-end Developer
- Back-end Developer
- Data Scientist
- DevOps (QA Engineer)

Sale, User flow, developer, whole structure, deploy on linux and test.


This is my first article for recording my experience of my product development and initializing of a start-up company (I'm not sure it will be achieve at the future, but I do my best.) and any thinking, obstacles I will face.

In my Blog, I like to emphasize more about my feelings and how to overcome those obstacles, I still write experience of technologies, but most I will put them in Github or open another category/ articles.

## About me

This is my first time challenge for writing post by English, I used to do it but I did't, now I think it's good opportunity to begin this. 


When I started to develop my product and I found that make a product is not easy, many people cooperation, teamwork, different reason opinion.

record my product.
